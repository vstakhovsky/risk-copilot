## 🌍 Problem
Technical Product Managers spend days aligning risks, dependencies, legal and operational constraints across Jira, Confluence, GitHub, and endless meetings.  
This leads to delays, misalignment, and knowledge loss.

🚀 One-click "Project Analysis Blast" for Technical Product Managers
Risk Copilot is a powerful desktop and web tool that explodes an entire project context into structured, actionable deliverables designed for modern product management workflows. Think of it as a rapid-fire alternative to manually analyzing risks across dozens of documents and stakeholder conversations:

- Select project folder → get instant comprehensive analysis with risks + scope options + RACI + ADRs + diagrams in a predictable, evidence-backed format (out/risks.md, out/scope_options.md, out/raci.csv, etc.)
- Configure analysis agents to exclude noise (outdated docs, irrelevant constraints, legacy decisions...)
- Export the results into your favorite project management tool, present to stakeholders, or integrate into existing workflows with GitHub-style diffs
- Receive evidence-scored deliverables and apply changes with confidence backed by AI reasoning

Risk Copilot trades manual risk assessment for an "intelligent multi-agent blast" – hence the focus on comprehensive analysis and actionable outputs.

---

## 🎯 Scenario

| Scenario | Pain Point | Risk Copilot Benefit |
|---|---|---|
| **Cross-team alignment** | “We need to align 12 teams on project risks.” | Generates unified risk view<br>with stakeholder mapping across all teams<br>and evidence scores. |
| **Compliance documentation** | Manual RACI creation misses regulatory requirements. | AI identifies compliance gaps and auto-generates audit-ready RACI matrices. |
| **Technical decision tracking** | ADRs are inconsistent or missing critical context. | Produces evidence-backed ADRs with traceable decision rationale and alternatives. |
| **Scope creep management** | Stakeholders want “everything” without trade-off analysis. | Delivers multiple scope options with clear cost/benefit analysis and timeline impact. |
| **Executive reporting** | Status updates require manual data gathering from multiple sources. | Unified dashboard shows real-time project health with exportable executive summaries. |

---

## 💎 Value
- Ready-to-use **PR artifacts** with traceable evidence and GitHub-style diffs.  
- Unified **status dashboard** for releases, dependencies, and scope changes.  
- Seamless integration into existing workflows.

---

## ✨ Features

- ⚡ **Fast multi-agent analysis** *(Python + FastAPI backend)* — comprehensive project assessment in minutes
- ✅ **Interactive agent configuration** — select exactly what you need: risks, scope, RACI, ADRs, diagrams
- 📊 **Evidence & confidence scoring** — every recommendation backed by traceable reasoning
- 🔍 **GitHub-style diffs** — see exactly what changed and why with a full audit trail
- 🪶 **Lightweight integration** — desktop app, web UI, CLI, and REST API
- 💻 **Cross-platform** — Windows, macOS, Linux, and web browsers

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture
This describes the analysis flow. The core multi-agent orchestration and artifact generation remain the primary backend logic for creating deliverables based on project context and selected analysis profiles.

## 📱 Desktop Application Workflow

Run the application — the **Risk Copilot** window opens with a **4-step interface**.

---

### 1) Upload Context
- Click `Select Project Folder` and choose your project repository root.
- In the left **Project Files** pane, expand folders and **un-tick** items to exclude from analysis *(e.g., logs, build artifacts, `node_modules`, etc.)*.
- Pick an **Analysis Profile** in the sidebar:
  - 🚀 **Startup** — speed, MVP focus, resource optimization  
  - 🏢 **Enterprise** — governance, compliance, stakeholder alignment  
  - 💳 **Fintech** — security, PCI/SOX, regulatory compliance  
  - 🏥 **Healthcare** — HIPAA, FDA approval, patient safety  
- Click **`Prepare Project Context & Proceed`**.  
  *The project context is generated and analyzed internally.*

---

### 3) Execute Analysis
- The UI switches to **Step 3** *(real-time progress)*. Observe:
  - **Overall Progress** — completion % across all agents  
  - **Per-Agent Status** — live updates with confidence scores  
  - **Evidence Feed** — streaming findings and reasoning  
- Typical duration: **≈ 2–5 minutes** *(depends on project size)*.
- Click **`View Results`** when complete.

---

### 4) Export & Integrate

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Possible Cause | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `claude: API key not found` | Missing or invalid API key | Set `CLAUDE_API_KEY` in your `.env` with a valid Anthropic API key. |
| `Analysis stuck at 0%` | Network issues or API rate limits | Check internet connection, verify API key permissions, and wait for rate-limit reset. |
| `Large files failing upload` | File size exceeds limits | Use document chunking, compress files, or split very large repositories. |
| `Empty artifact outputs` | Insufficient project context | Provide detailed requirements and include stakeholder information. |
| `Agent configuration errors` | Invalid parameter combinations | Review agent compatibility matrix; check confidence threshold ranges. |
| `Memory issues during analysis` | Large document processing | Increase available RAM, enable streaming/iterative processing, and ensure GC is enabled. |
| `Export integration failures` | Invalid credentials or permissions | Verify API tokens, repository permissions, and test webhook endpoints. |
| `Web UI not loading` | Frontend build or dependency issues | Run `npm install && npm run build`, then refresh and check browser console for errors. |
